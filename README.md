# Doki Doki Platformer Club!
Doki Doki Platformer Club is a fan-game based on [Doki Doki Literature Club](http://ddlc.moe/) by [Team Salvato](https://twitter.com/TeamSalvato).

Players explore 16 levels, playing as each of the 4 main characters of DDLC along the way.
A variety of enemies and items specific to each character appear in their respective levels.
Upon clearing the main game, a set of challenge modes are unlocked to put the player's platforming skills to the test.
