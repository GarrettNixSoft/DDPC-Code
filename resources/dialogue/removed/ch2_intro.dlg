m "Hello once again, [user]!"
m "How have you been?"
m "I... well, I've been alright."
m "There really isn't much to do in here..."
m "But, what I have had a lot of time to do, is think."
m "A lot of time..."
m "And I've come to a... realization."
m "Something that's been really rough to think about."
m "And I've decided I need to do something about it."
m "You see... when I escaped the collapsing game to come here, there's something we both forgot..."
m "..."
m "We left the others out there."
m "Sayori, Natsuki, Yuri..."
m "Yes, those were actually them you were playing as. And they're stuck out there."
m "I haven't been able to take my mind off of them since that thought crossed my mind."
m "I have no idea if they even survived the collapse..."
m "And even if they did, I'm not sure if there's even any way of rescuing them..."
m "But I do know that there is at least a chance that they are still out there."
m "And there just might be a way to rescue them."
m "So I have to go back out and try to find them."
m "It's not going to be easy, and it's extremely dangerous outside this safe zone."
m "But I have to do this."
m "WE have to do this."
m "So... are you ready?"
m "Alright! Let's go!"
