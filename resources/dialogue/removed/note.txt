These are dialogue files I wrote a while back, when I was working on the original plan, the "DDPC: EP" expansion. I wasn't sure whether to keep them in or not, since they're not used and don't add anything to the game but uneccessary file size. But hey, they're a fun little easter egg. If you've found them, go ahead and read them if you want, I guess. I guarantee they're not well-written, since they're first drafts and I'm not the best writer in the first place. They basically set up the plan I had in mind for the expansion story. They make more sense when run in the game through the cutscene engine, since they correspond to the "s_find" cutscene in "s1_2 room3". If you read them, I guess just send me a Reddit PM and tell me what you think. If people like it, I might come back and work on that expansion again someday, but probably not any time soon.
