If DDPC fails to restart explorer.exe after completing the game with "Meta Content" enabled, then
something on your computer has blocked the game from starting a new process on your machine. Fortunately,
explorer.exe is very easy to restart manually, and there are a couple of different methods for doing so.
Which method you will chose depends on the permissions you have on the machine you're using. Please refer
to the following list of only 2 methods that I could come up with while writing this:

Permission levels:

Owners, Administrators, or Unrestricted Users - Use method 1
Restricted Users (cannot use Task Manager) - Use method 2



METHOD 1: The easy one

1. Use "Ctrl + Shift + Escape" to open Task Manager.
2. Select "File > Start a new task" and enter "explorer.exe"
3. All done!

METHOD 2: The one I came up with in high school to get away with stuff*

1. Use "Ctrl + Shift + Escape" to open Task Manager.
2. Select any program currently running, and right click.
3. Select "Open file location."
4. This will open an Explorer window. Use it to navigate to C:\Windows\
5. Find "explorer.exe" in this directory and run it.
6. All done!


*If you're curious, ask me (Floober101) about this in the DDPC discord: https://discord.gg/nQCR32k


NOTE: if you know another way of doing it, which someone probably does, then let me know in the DDPC discord
and I'll add it on a new text channel people can refer to for future reference.
